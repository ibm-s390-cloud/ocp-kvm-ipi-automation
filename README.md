# OpenShift on KVM IPI Installation Automation for IBM zSystems / LinuxONE (and IBM Power Systems and Intel / AMD x86_64 and ARM64)

This repository contains Ansible playbooks to install an OpenShift cluster via the OpenShift installer 'IPI' method (installer-provisioned infrastructure) using KVM and libvirt on a dedicated Linux host.
The primary focus of these playbooks is installing and configuring OpenShift on IBM zSystems / LinuxONE hosts (architecture: s390x) but IBM Power System hosts (architecture: ppc64le), Intel-based hosts (architecture: x86_64) and ARM64-based hosts (architecture: aarch64) are also supported.
